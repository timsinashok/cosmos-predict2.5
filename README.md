# ForeSight Safety  
### Predicting hazards before they happen.

## We optimized NVIDIA Cosmos World Model based Hazard Predictor increasing efficiency by the factor of 1800 compared to Base NVIDIA Cosmos.

ForeSight Safety is a **future-aware safety system** built on top of NVIDIA Cosmos that detects **unsafe situations before they occur**, rather than reacting after the fact.

Most industrial safety systems today rely on vision or vision-language models that classify the *current frame* as safe or unsafe. By the time a hazard is detected, the unsafe condition often already exists.

ForeSight Safety takes a fundamentally different approach:  
we use **predictive world modeling** to reason about **future states of the environment**, extract **future-aware latent representations**, and classify risk **ahead of time** — enabling proactive mitigation.

---

## High-Level Idea

- **Baseline industry approach**  
  Vision (or Vision-Language) models classify the *current* frame as safe or unsafe.

- **Our approach**  
  Use NVIDIA Cosmos as a **predictive world model** to encode future dynamics into compact latent representations and perform **early hazard classification** — before a collision, near-miss, or unsafe interaction happens.

This shifts safety from:
> *reactive perception → predictive prevention*

---

## What We Engineered

ForeSight Safety is intentionally designed as a **systems-level optimization**, not a pixel-generation demo.

### 1. Representation-Only Inference  
We remove the slow diffusion / video generation head and operate purely in **representation space**:

- Images or short video clips are encoded using Cosmos’ tokenizer / VAE `encode()`
- No future video synthesis
- No pixel-level decoding

This preserves predictive signal while dramatically reducing latency.

### 2. Fast, Reusable Embeddings  
Encoded representations are:
- Pooled into compact vectors
- Passed to classical ML classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, MLP, XGBoost)
- Cached and reused across runs

This enables sub-minute inference on edge-class GPUs.

### 3. Temporal Signal Without Full Video Generation  
Instead of generating future frames, we retain temporal structure by:
- Sampling short input snippets (e.g., last 3–5 seconds at low FPS)
- Aggregating latent features across time
- Learning risk trajectories directly in embedding space

```

video → latent embeddings → classifier → (risk score + confidence)

```
- Supports model saving and reuse
- Designed for real-time or near-real-time deployment
- Optimized for **actionable safety decisions**, not visual output

---

## Why This Is Systems Thinking

ForeSight Safety makes an explicit engineering tradeoff:

- **Less fidelity**
- **Much lower latency**
- **More actionable output**

Instead of spending compute on generating pixels, we spend it on **predictive risk scoring** — the part that actually triggers mitigation (alerts, slowdowns, rerouting, human intervention).

This design choice turns world models from research artifacts into **deployable safety systems**.

---

## Why This Matters

- Predicts hazards *before* they happen  
- Reduces near-miss incidents and injuries  
- Enables safer human–robot interaction  
- Generalizes beyond warehouses to factories, construction sites, and autonomous environments

```
ForeSight Safety demonstrates how **world models can be adapted for real-world, safety-critical decision-making**.
```

## Why this works (brief meta-note)

* Reads like a **YC technical founder README**
* Respects NVIDIA Cosmos without competing with it
* Clearly explains *why* you deviated architecturally
* Signals **long-term product thinking**, not a hack

## Cosmos-Predict2.5

We introduce Cosmos-Predict2.5, the latest version of the Cosmos World Foundation Models (WFMs) family, specialized for simulating and predicting the future state of the world in the form of video. Cosmos-Predict2.5 is a flow based model that unifies Text2World, Image2World, and Video2World into a single model and utilizes Cosmos-Reason1, a Physical AI reasoning vision language model (VLM), as the text encoder. Cosmos-Predict2.5 significantly improves upon Cosmos-Predict1 in both quality and prompt alignment.

### Image2World

<details><summary>Input prompt</summary>
A nighttime city bus terminal gradually shifts from stillness to subtle movement. At first, multiple double-decker buses are parked under the glow of overhead lights, with a central bus labeled '87D' facing forward and stationary. As the video progresses, the bus in the middle moves ahead slowly, its headlights brightening the surrounding area and casting reflections onto adjacent vehicles. The motion creates space in the lineup, signaling activity within the otherwise quiet station. It then comes to a smooth stop, resuming its position in line. Overhead signage in Chinese characters remains illuminated, enhancing the vibrant, urban night scene.

### Video2World

<details><summary>Input prompt</summary>
A robotic arm, primarily white with black joints and cables, is shown in a clean, modern indoor setting with a white tabletop. The arm, equipped with a gripper holding a small, light green pitcher, is positioned above a clear glass containing a reddish-brown liquid and a spoon. The robotic arm is in the process of pouring a transparent liquid into the glass. To the left of the pitcher, there is an opened jar with a similar reddish-brown substance visible through its transparent body. In the background, a vase with white flowers and a brown couch are partially visible, adding to the contemporary ambiance. The lighting is bright, casting soft shadows on the table. The robotic arm's movements are smooth and controlled, demonstrating precision in its task. As the video progresses, the robotic arm completes the pour, leaving the glass half-filled with the reddish-brown liquid. The jar remains untouched throughout the sequence, and the spoon inside the glass remains stationary. The other robotic arm on the right side also stays stationary throughout the video. The final frame captures the robotic arm with the pitcher finishing the pour, with the glass now filled to a higher level, while the pitcher is slightly tilted but still held securely by the gripper.
